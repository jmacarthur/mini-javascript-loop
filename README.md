mini-javascript-loop
====================

Minimal JavaScript/HTML5 game loop. This is a basic 2D game loop for HTML5 written in JavaScript.
It's a stripped version of my Ludum Dare 28 entry.
There's a simple bitmap font which contains the capital letters, digits 0-9 and a few extra characters.

The loop updates a simple sprite which can be moved using arrow keys or WASD and is constrained the screen size of 640x480.

A sound sample is also loaded, but not used in this example.
